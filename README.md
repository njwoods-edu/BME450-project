## Project decription
We will be claassifying images of breast ultrasounds into 3 groups: benign, malignant, and normal.

We plan to use this dataset: Al-Dhabyani W, Gomaa M, Khaled H, Fahmy A. Dataset of breast ultrasound images. Data in Brief. 2020 Feb;28:104863. DOI: 10.1016/j.dib.2019.104863.
This dataset was obtained from Kaggle, uploaded by Arya Shah

We plan to use a convolutional neural network to accomplish this calssification.

We hope that with creating this neural netowrk an image can be uploaded to detect whether or not a malignant tumor is present for more rapid diagnosis and verifcation of said diagnoses.
